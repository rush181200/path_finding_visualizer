# Pathfinding Visualizer

This is a pathfinding visualizer tool that allows you to visualize how different pathfinding algorithms work. You can choose from Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS), A*, Greedy Best-First Search, and Dijkstra's algorithm. Additionally, you can adjust the speed of the visualization, the size of each pixel, and generate mazes to test the algorithms.

## Features

- Visualize DFS, BFS, A*, Greedy Best-First Search, and Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Adjust the speed of the visualization.
- Change the size of each pixel for a clearer view.
- Generate mazes to test the algorithms.

## Getting Started

To run the visualizer, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
2. Adjust the speed and pixel size using the sliders.
3. Click on the grid to add walls or obstacles.
4. Click "Visualize" to see the algorithm in action.
5. Click "Clear Grid" to reset the grid.
6. Click "Generate Maze" to create a maze for testing.

## Algorithms

- **Depth First Search (DFS)**: A recursive algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Breadth First Search (BFS)**: An algorithm that explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
- **A***: A heuristic search algorithm that finds the least-cost path from a given initial node to one goal node.
- **Greedy Best-First Search**: A heuristic search algorithm that selects the node that is closest to the goal node.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.
